# advancedSelect
A select replacement which launches a dialog list. The list is searchable and can be extended with expanded views.

Full Documentation and examples are available at [moridiweb.com](http://moridiweb.com/advancedSelect.html).

For JSON calls ajaxExtend is required. TemplateEngine is required for loading the design.

Over the next few weeks there may be some major changes, I'm looking at decoupling templateEngine and ajaxExtend so that any template engine can be used or none at all, and ajax calls will be in your hands.
